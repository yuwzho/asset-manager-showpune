### Search code
Search files from workspace using below patterns:
- Glob pattern to find files: `**/*.java`
- Regex pattern to find code lines: `/SecretsManagerClient|AWSSecretsManager|SecretsManagerClientBuilder|AWSSecretsManagerClientBuilder/`
> you could use tools to search code whatever if possible.
### Instruction

[INTERNAL NOTE: This step must only be executed when the migration strategy is Path 1 or 4. If it is not Path 1 or 4, do not output anything.]
Your task is to migrate a Java file from using the AWS SecretsManager API to the Azure Keyvault API while maintaining the same functionality. Below is a reference to the relevant Azure Keyvault APIs for your convenience. You can tell whether it's an aws or Azure API from the package name.
Try replace all references to AWS SecretsManager APIs with equivalent Azure Keyvault APIs, using the provided API descriptions as guidance. Ensure the resulting code is clean, efficient, and preserves the original functionality.

Note that:
1. By default, use `DefaultAzureCredential` from the `com.azure.identity` package to authenticate the `SecretClient`. For example:
```java
SecretClient secretClient = new SecretClientBuilder()
  .vaultUrl(keyVaultUri)
  .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
  .buildClient();
```
2. Carefully check the codes, do not modify the methods/constants/configurations (e.g., `AWSCredentials`, `BasicAWSCredentials`) used by other AWS services (e.g., S3, SQS, SNS, etc.). Modify them only if they are exclusively used by AWS Secrets Manager.

Below are the APIs provided for your reference, don't forget to import the package whenever you are adding a new class reference in code edit:
